# Instinct-Analytics

A new way to review datasets, using AI and other automatated technologies. Features currently:

Observe Data - Quickly load up data from csv and turn it into bar charts. Explicitly shows the two most common values seen in data and groups rest under "Other"

Talk to Data- Text chat with Llama 3 model that has access to the csv, flexiable, and able to take in complex queries as it's using an LLM.

AI Recommendations/Interences - Llama 3 reviews the data giving a basic overview, inferences, and different suggested models for ML training on the data

Write Code for ML - Uses GPT-4 to write a Jupyter Notebook python file on training the data to create their own AI model based on the dataset.

# Extra info for judges

For LabLab.ai Llama 3 hackathon. Solo 2 day project that I plan on turning into a startup.

The "Thinking" can take a few minutes as my gpu is mid-range, couldn't use an API due to token amounts

Please message/mention me on discord @millionarc.sol once reviewed/judged as I am running the Llama server locally on my PC.

The installer and main application is Windows only as the installer is a bat file, however feel free to set up your own environment to run the code if on Linux/Mac

I included an example dataset on Anemia I found [here]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayeemmohammed/anemia-detection)) however feel free to use any dataset you'd like as long as it's named input.csv and in the same location

If running/testing the Jupyter Notebook file for Machine Learning, you will need to transfer the .ipynb file or copy the code into a python/Jupyter environment

If you have any other questions feel free to reach out @millionarc.sol on discord, I am on EST timezone (UTC-05)
