# Instinct-Analytics


For LabLab.ai Llama 3 hackathon. Solo 2 day project that I plan on turning into a startup.

Please message/mention me on discord @millionarc.sol once reviewed/judged as I am running the Llama server locally on my PC.

The installer and main application is Windows only as the installer is a bat file, however feel free to set up your own environment to run the code if on Linux/Mac

I included an example dataset on Anemia I found [here]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayeemmohammed/anemia-detection)) however feel free to use any dataset you'd like as long as it's named input.csv and in the same location

If running/testing the Jupyter Notebook file for Machine Learning, you will need to transfer the .ipynb file or copy the code into a python/Jupyter environment

If you have any other questions feel free to reach out @millionarc.sol on discord, I am on EST timezone (UTC-05)
